* 01 July 2025: Dr. Pei Qing, in collaboration with the Zhang Dian professorâ€™s team from Guangzhou University, published a new paper titled "Cultural innovations were boosted under the pressure of epidemic outbreaks in European History" in the *Nature* sub-journal *Humanities & Social Sciences Communications*. <br><br>
Based on the "Ecological pressure stimulates cultural innovation" theory proposed by the team, the paper systematically and empirically tested the causal relationship of cultural innovation in human society under epidemic pressure for the first time. The research team collected data on epidemics in Europe between 1000 and 1900 AD, the number of innovative thinkers and their impact scores, records of scientific discoveries and technological innovations, and time series indicators of ecological-socioeconomic processes. Through methods such as Pearson correlation analysis, multivariate Poisson and linear regression analysis, and Granger causality analysis, the team conducted a comprehensive and quantitative verification of the stimulating effect of epidemic outbreaks as an ecological challenge on social and cultural innovation, strictly testing the causal relationship criteria of the model.<br>
The results show that infectious disease epidemics and the socio-economic pressures they caused (e.g., Consumer Price Index) effectively stimulated the activity and prosperity of thinkers and philosophers in the fields of truth, knowledge, and ethics, further promoting scientific discovery and technological innovation. Additionally, the paper analyzes the COVID-19 pandemic and other 20th-century epidemics, further proving the creative thinking, technological breakthroughs, and action innovations shown by human society under epidemic pressure. These factors together enhance society's adaptability and creativity.<br>

* 01 October 2024:  Dr. Pei Qing and Dr. Qiu Mengyuan published a new paper titled "Cost of resilience to climate change: migration, conflicts, and epidemics in imperial China" in *Environmental Research Letters*. <br><br>
This study examines the cost of social resilience to climate change in imperial China (200 BCEâ€“1840 CE), focusing on the chain reaction: climate change â†’ nomadic migration â†’ nomadâ€“farmer conflicts â†’ epidemics. It empirically identifies and analyzes the cost, particularly the impact of nomadic societies on agrarian societies. The study reveals that climate-driven nomadic migrations directly caused conflicts with agrarian communities and indirectly led to epidemics. It emphasizes the importance of early identification of resilience costs and highlights the value of peaceful cross-civilizational and inter-societal interactions in addressing climate challenges. These findings contribute to the understanding of climate justice and offer practical insights for minimizing resilience costs.<br>

* 13 June 2024: Dr. Qiu Mengyuan and Dr. Pei Qing published a new paper titled "Lost in Luxury: Climate Change and Silk Consumption in Mid-Qing China (1735â€“1840 CE)" in *The Professional Geographer*. <br><br>
This study statistically examines the relationship between climate change and the Qing dynasty imperial court's luxury spending on silk products. It finds that favorable climatic conditions and a flourishing agrarian economy promoted silk consumption, while natural disasters and social crises had little impact on it. The study serves as the first attempt to reveal a long-term historical climateâ€“luxury linkage and further provides a supplementary explanation of the economic decline from the perspective of the history of climate and society.<br>
