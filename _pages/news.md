* 18 September 2024:  Dr. Pei Qing and Dr. Qiu Mengyuan published a new paper titled "Cost of resilience to climate change: migration, conflicts, and epidemics in imperial China" in *Environmental Research Letters*. <br><br>
This study examines the cost of social resilience to climate change in imperial China (200 BCEâ€“1840 CE), focusing on the chain reaction: climate change â†’ nomadic migration â†’ nomadâ€“farmer conflicts â†’ epidemics. The research empirically identifies and analyzes the cost of resilience to climate change, particularly in the direction of nomadic societies affecting agrarian societies in historical China. It reveals that climate-driven nomadic migrations directly caused conflicts with agrarian communities and indirectly led to epidemics. The study emphasizes the importance of early identification of resilience costs and highlights the value of peaceful cross-civilizational and inter-societal interactions in addressing climate challenges. These findings contribute to the understanding of climate justice and offer practical insights for minimizing resilience costs.<br>

* 13 June 2024: Dr. Qiu Mengyuan and Dr. Pei Qing published a new paper titled "Lost in Luxury: Climate Change and Silk Consumption in Mid-Qing China (1735â€“1840 CE)" in *The Professional Geographer*. <br><br>
This study statistically examines the relationship between climate change and the Qing dynasty imperial court's luxury spending on silk products. It finds that favorable climatic conditions and a flourishing agrarian economy promoted silk consumption, while natural disasters and social crises had little impact on it. The study serves as the first attempt to reveal a long-term historical climateâ€“luxury linkage and further provides a supplementary explanation of the economic decline from the perspective of the history of climate and society.<br>
